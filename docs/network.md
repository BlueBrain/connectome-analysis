# Functions for working with networks

This page describes functions contained in the `network` module. 
The functions are arranged by motivation, either from classic graph and network theory, or from topology.

## Topology

These functions are topologically motivated.

::: src.connalysis.network.topology
    options:
      docstring_style: numpy


## Classic

These functions are classic graph theoretic functions.

::: src.connalysis.network.classic
    options:
      docstring_style: numpy

## Local

These are utility functions used to restrict analyses to neighborhoods.

::: src.connalysis.network.local
    options:
      docstring_style: numpy

## Stats

These are utility functions used to compute simple statistics across simplices and neighborhoods.

::: src.connalysis.network.stats
    options:
      docstring_style: numpy
