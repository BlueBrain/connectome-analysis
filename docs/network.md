## This page describes functions contained in the `network` module.  These are arranged by motivation, either: 

* [Topology](network_topology.md): Network analyses that are topologically motivated.
* [Classic](network_classic.md): Network analyses based on classic graph theoretic metrics.
* [Local](network_local.md): Utility functions to restrict analyses to neighborhoods.
* [Stats](network_stats.md): Utility functions to compute simple statistics across simplices and neighborhoods.
