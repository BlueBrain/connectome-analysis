# connalysis: Functions to analyze connectomes

This package provides a library of general functions to analyze connectomes. Functions are divided into three groups:

* [Network](network.md): Graph theoretic and topological functions of connectomes
* [Modelling](modelling.md): Functions to model (parametrize) the connectivity of connectomes
* [Randomization](randomization.md): Generation of randomized controls of connectomes
