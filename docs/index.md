# connalysis: Functions to analyze connectomes

This package provides a library of general functions to analyze connectomes. Functions are divided into two groups:

* [Modelling](modelling.md): Functions to construct connectomes with specific properties
* [Network](network.md): Graph theoretic and topological functions evaluated on connectomes
* [Randomization](randomization.md): Graph theoretic and topological functions evaluated on connectomes
